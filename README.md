# CG

## Summary

This is the repository to develop the project for the discipline of Graphic Computation.

### Fase 1

In this fase, the code should generate a list of objects, wich are:

* Plane
* Box
* Sphere
* Cone
* Torus

There are two main files in the project **engine.cpp** and **generator.cpp**. The second one is used to generate all the vertices of the primitive and write those coordinates to a file *.3d*. In this way, the first file reads a file *.xml* that has in it the name of the file generated by the second one. Therefor, the primite is computed and showed to the user.

## Dependecies

This projects depends on two libraries:

* [tinyxml2](https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2/tree/321ea883b7190d4e85cae5512a12e5eaa8f8731f)
* [glm](https://github.com/icaven/glm)

This librarys should be install before running the code.

## Build

To run the project you need to have [cmake](https://cmake.org) in your machine.
Ensured that you have all the dependices install, the steps to build the code are, in Linux distributions:

1. `mkdir build`
2. `cd build`
3. `cmake .`
4. `make`


## Run

Assuming that the previous step was concluded, you just need to know 2 commands to run the code:

* `./generator primitive (arguments) name_file.3d`

To see the primite run:

* `./engine file.xml`

To know how the file *.xml* should be, see the example (example.xml) in the root of the repository.

The following list describes the arguments for all primitives:

* `plane dimension divisions`
* `box dimension divisions`
* `cone height radius slices stacks`
* `sphere radius slices stacks`
* `torus radius radius_tube slices stacks`
