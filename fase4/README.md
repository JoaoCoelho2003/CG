# CG

## Summary

This repository is for developing the project for the Graphic Computation discipline.

### Phase 1

In this phase, the code should generate a list of objects, which are:

* Plane
* Box
* Sphere
* Cone
* Torus

There are two main files in the project: **engine.cpp** and **generator.cpp**. The second one is used to generate all the vertices of the primitives and write those coordinates to a file *.3d*. In this way, the first file reads a file *.xml* that contains the name of the file generated by the second one. Therefore, the primitive is computed and shown to the user.

## Dependecies

This projects depends on two libraries:

* [tinyxml2](https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2/tree/321ea883b7190d4e85cae5512a12e5eaa8f8731f)
* [glm](https://github.com/icaven/glm)

This libraries should be installed before running the code.

## Build

To run the project, you need to have [cmake](https://cmake.org) installed on your machine. After ensuring that you have all the dependencies installed, follow these steps to build the code on Linux distributions:

1. `mkdir build`
2. `cd build`
3. `cmake .`
4. `make`


## Run

Assuming that the previous steps were completed, you just need to know 2 commands to run the code:

* `./generator primitive (arguments) name_file.3d`
  
To view the primitive, run:

* `./engine file.xml`

To understand how the file *.xml* should be formatted, refer to the example (example.xml) in the root of the repository.

The following list describes the arguments for all primitives:

* `plane dimension divisions`
* `box dimension divisions`
* `cone height radius slices stacks`
* `sphere radius slices stacks`
* `torus radius radius_tube slices stacks`
